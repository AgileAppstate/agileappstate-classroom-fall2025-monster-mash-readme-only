I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

chorus 1 goes here

(Wa-ooh) from my laboratory in the castle east
(Wa-ooh) to the master bedroom where the vampires feast
(Wa-wa-ooh) the ghouls all came from their humble abodes
(Wa-ooh) to get a jolt from my electrodes
