I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

(He did the mash) He did the Monster Mash
(The Monster Mash) it was a graveyard smash
(He did the Mash) it caught on in a flash
(He did the Mash) he did the Monster Mash

(Wa-ooh) from my laboratory in the castle east
(Wa-ooh) to the master bedroom where the vampires feast
(Wa-wa-ooh) the ghouls all came from their humble abodes
ONE EXTRA LINE REMOVE THIS LINE
(Wa-ooh) to get a jolt from my electrodes
