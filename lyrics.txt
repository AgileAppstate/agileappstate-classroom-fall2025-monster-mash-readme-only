I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

chorus 1 goes here

(Wa-ooh) from my laboratory in the castle east
(Wa-ooh) to the master bedroom where the vampires feast
(Wa-wa-ooh) the ghouls all came from their humble abodes
(Wa-ooh) to get a jolt from my electrodes

chorus 2 goes here

(Wa-ooh) the zombies were having fun
(Ta-da-shoop, wa-ooh) the party had just begun
(Ta-da-shoop, wa-ooh) the guests included Wolfman
(Ta-da-shoop, wa-ooh) Dracula, and his son

(Wa-ooh) the scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
(Wa-ooh) Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
(Wa-wa-ooh) the coffin-bangers were about to arrive
(Wa-ooh) with their vocal group, The Crypt-Kicker Five
