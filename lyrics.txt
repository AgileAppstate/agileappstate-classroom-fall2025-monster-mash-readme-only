I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

(He did the mash) He did the Monster Mash
(The Monster Mash) it was a graveyard smash
(He did the Mash) it caught on in a flash
(He did the Mash) he did the Monster Mash
